# 2020 Advent of Code

### Running the solution

To run each solution, first build the program from within the directory:

```bash
go build .
```

Then run the program as a regular binary program:

```bash
./part1
```

or:

```bash
./part2
```

If the program accepts arguments, it will print a usage string.
